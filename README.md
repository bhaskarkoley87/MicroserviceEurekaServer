# MiroserviceEurekaServer
The key part of service discovery is the registry. I used Netflix Eureka for this project. Eureka is a good example of the client-side discovery pattern, when the client is responsible for determining the locations of available service instances (using a registry server) and load balancing requests across them.  With Spring Boot, you can easily build Eureka Registry with a spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server dependency, @EnableEurekaServer annotation, and simple configuration properties.
